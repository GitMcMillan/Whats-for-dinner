What's for Dinner?

The never ending question: what to have for dinner. This web application will help you create new and interesting meals for yourself and your family.

Along the top you will find 2 drop-down menu's. 

Start with the one marked Select a Country. When clicked the drop-down will display a list of countries. Once you have selected a country, you can select food item that comes from that country.

After you have select an item in the drop-down, you should see an image of that food appear.

If you click on the image a modal should pop-up and display the ingredients and the recipe for that food item.

You can click anywhere outside the box to close the modal.

The last thing you can do with your web page is add your own recipes. Enter the name of your recipe, then nter in the main ingredients, and the full recipe. Finally click submit.

The name of your meal should print onto the page to the right side. Now if you hover over the name a modal that lists the Meal Type, Ingredients and Recipe should appear. To close the screen just stop hovering the name.
